 ## This project is Enlgish Test Web App.
This project was initially bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for CSR(Client-Side-Rendering) but recently being modified to [NextJS]() because of necessity about SSR(Server-Side-Rendering) for more improval performances, and also using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) for state management, furthermore used [React Query]() for management of data fetching from DB, used [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static typed definition, and all App components are being served on [Nginx]() server in [Docker]() container running on [WSL2]() environment.
